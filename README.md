# Simple Themes & Scrolling

A simple web project that demonstrates theme switching and a scroll-to-top button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Theme Switcher:** Select from four color themes (Light Sea Green, Light Coral, Light Blue, Light Salmon) by clicking colored boxes. The selected theme is saved in localStorage and persists across page reloads.
- **Scroll-to-Top Button:** A button appears when you scroll down 500px or more. Clicking it smoothly scrolls the page back to the top.

## Usage
1. Click any colored box to change the background theme.
2. Scroll down the page; the `^` button will appear at the bottom right. Click it to return to the top.
